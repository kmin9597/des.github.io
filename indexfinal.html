        <p>For this project, as a group, we had to come up with a logo of the company and individual poster that advertise the company. We were on part of Mountain view team, where it advertise place to sleep at the mountain. From this poster, I wanted to provide people to feel the freedom and freshness that mountain provides to human. </p>

      <p>Designing a poster for MeToo event gave me difficulty, since it is a event where not only design should look attractive but also allow people to get inspired and confident from the piece. Rather than focusing too many things, I decided to focus on main topic, the significant message from the event. </p>

      <p>There were no instruction or any guideline for this poster, so I had to come up with from beginning to end. I started with choosing two colors that I want to use for the poster and slowly trying other colors to add. Overall, all the colors went along and became an effective poster, where the color combination gives warmness in the poster. </p>

      <p>This is a book cover that I did during summer. In book cover, dividing sections are very important. I spent time creating design, where people can find warmth in their heart by just looking at the book cover. I also divided sections where it is mainly book cover, but also having a sections for author and summary of the book.</p>

      <p>This is another poster for the MeToo event. The challenge that I faced during the project is that I did not know how to interact with audience with solely my design. But as I learn more about graphics and throw in ideas and being more creative, I realized that my work gets more developed and creative design.</p>

      <p>This is a template that I created during DES 115 class. The difficult part of this project is using gird system. Since it is for a template, it should be clean and attractive, where users can easily read the information and get interested by the design. By using the rulers in the InDesign system, I was able to create clean line and overall making the template looks clean.</p>
