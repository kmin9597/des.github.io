      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>I decided to go to South Korea by myself. Even though I borned in Korea, it was difficult to go there, since my life was so busy with other things. With all the money that I gained from working, I purchased the flight ticket. When I first
        landed in Korea, everything changed so much from 2006, the last time I visited Korea. I went to all popular places in Korea, and I really found interesting where they use different stucture of the language to elders. The Korean culture
        definitely inspired me. Also the most amazing part in this trip was food. Even though my mom is good cook, there were so many korean foods that I did not experience before. Every meal tastes incredible. It was definitely non-stop eating
        trip, which allow me to gain 5pounds during my 2weeks trip. My favorite food in Korea was Bulgogi and jajagmun. One other thing that I really liked about Korea is that public transporation in Korea is so well made. I cannot imagine my life
        without a car in the United States. But in Korea, rather than driving a car, most people use public transportation, since it basically goes to all different places. Even though Korea is a small country, I realized it is very well organized
        and well structured. The whole 2 weeks trip was amazing. If I have another chance to visit Korea, I would love to stay more than a month! Two weeks were defintely not enough time for me!

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>I planned my trip to Korea during my summer break. I was very excited but there was one huge barrier that I had to go through, which was y parent's aggrement. Both of my parents strongly disagree with me going Korea by myself. Since I
        planned this trip for so long, I was not able to give up this time. Rather than arguing with my parents, I decided to show my whole schedule in Korea to my parents. I wrote down my whole plan for every thirty mintues, and explained what I
        will do in Korea. Surprisngly, both of my parents understood my passion in this trip and said yes for korea trip. From this experience I realized how important communication is between people. I had amazing time in Korea, but I also learned
        the importace of planning and making sure that I am safe to my parents!
