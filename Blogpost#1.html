          <h2>Problems that Africa is Facing</h2>
          <p>Poverty
          </p>
          <p>
            Poverty is one the biggest problem that Africa is facing today. Most of Sub-Saharan Africa resulted the lowest income category, which is less than$765 Gross National Income (GNI) per person per year, in the year. This means that there are many people who are suffering from huge debt in their lives. Other regions in Africa shows even lower rate.
          </p>
          <p>Aids
          </p>
          <p>
            The rate of the aids in Africa hit 6.2% of the world’s population. The death rate of children raise higher every year, which means that the food and water that country has and provides have problem. It is necessary for government to implement any policies that allow people to receive goods.
          </p>
          <p>Trade
          </p>
          <p>
            Africa has various natural resources, such as minerals, timer, and oil, that allow them to gain money from. But trading is one of the difficult process they always suffer until now days. Since there are negative factors, such as poor infrastructure, government instability, and Aids, other countries are unwilling to do trade business, since it can cause any problem.

          <h2>What did we do in order to IMPROVE?</h2>
          <p>All the problems in Africa are all related to each other. Government is on the path of economic transformation, where moving workers from low-productivity sectors like agriculture to higher-productivity areas like industry and the service sector, as well as increasing productivity growth within sectors. This can solve the economic issue, which can increase people’s income and lower their debts. There are various communities that allows Africans to get trained in different areas. Approximately 100,000 individuals got trained to create financial literacy and life skills in urban and rural communities throughout South Africa. People’s learning allows people to work and learn, which leads for them to have available budgets, thereby increasing impact and reach.
