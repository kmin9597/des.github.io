      <h3>Why we need civic and social responsibility in web</h3>
      <p>In now days, people web search in every area. Whenever people have question about how company or any social group run, behave, or have impact to society, environment, and world, they usually search online to find more information and resolve their curiosity. Since the world is very media-centered, it is important for company or group to provide information about their civic and social responsibility. If there is no website for any business or group, people assume they don’t exist. In order to communicate with people and population, any business, especially the ones that include social responsibility have to have website that has sufficient information and easy guide, so people can easily find the information that they are looking for. </p>
