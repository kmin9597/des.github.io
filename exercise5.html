      <h2> Linda Lee and Kelly Armstrong</h2>
      <p>Source Serif Pro is a serif typeface in the transitional style that was designed by Frank Grießhammer at Adobe in 2014. The font is designed to complement Source Sans, and this harmony is achieved through the careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. It also draws upon a longer history associated with its usage. Source Serif Pro is loosely based on the 18th century work of Pierre Simon Fournier. Fournier’s font was reworked for modern age, which is why it’s used for body copy on so many websites. One website that uses the font effectively to display body text in a clean and legible manner is the Supremo Type Terms website. To date, it is featured in over 180,000 websites, and is most widely used in United States. What my partner and I most appreciate about this font is the tracking between the letters and the simplicity and clarity of each glyph in the typeface. Source Serif Pro is most popularly paired with Roboto, a widely known serif typeface. It is also often paired with Open Sans and Source Sans Pro. </p>
